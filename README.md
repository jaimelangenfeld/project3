An overview of the project and its purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare crime rates in cities across Wisconsin over the span of a decade, specifically focusing on the years 2009 and 2019. We hope to identify trends and patterns in the data, as well as possible explaination of any outliers in the dataset. 

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project


At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

government sources not stolen data,
they let us know that data was different and sometimes couldn't be compared, 
letting know limitations overtime and giving us the information making users aware of when their data can/cannot be used
privacy protected because the data does not include names or other personal information
keeping in mind over-policing in certain cities/areas
