#Overview of the project/purpose:

The purpose of this project is to analyze and compare crime rates in cities across Wisconsin over the span of a decade, specifically focusing on the years 2009 and 2019. We hope to identify trends and patterns in the data, as well as possible explaination of any outliers in the dataset. 

#Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:

For the map portion of this data, you'll be able to see the amount of violent crime described and shown on the map of Wisconsin. Each dot size represents the amount of crime, the red portion being Violent Crime in 2009 while the blue dot being Violent Crime in 2019. 

#At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made:

The government sources we used provided information that is not obtained through stolen data. They inform us that the data may vary and, at times, cannot be directly compared. This transparency is crucial in acknowledging the limitations over time, making users aware of when their data can or cannot be used. Moreover, the government ensures privacy protection by excluding names and other personal information from the data. This approach is mindful of the potential for over-policing in certain cities or areas, promoting responsible and ethical use of information.
